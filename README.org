* Bughunter

Bughunter is a web tool for teaching and learning programming. It uses two different approaches: finding and identifying bugs in existing code and Parson's problems.

** Planning
Code will be stored in the database as a model. Parsons problems will simply split the code on new lines (preserving or consuming whitespace, as requested).
